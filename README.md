===================

## Assumptions
The default table size is 5x5 but can be changed.  
Invalid input will be ignored (such as empty line, misspelt command or direction, etc)

## Processing
The application processes a stream of commands by parsing text, filtering out invalid input, discarding illegal commands and executing the correct ones.
